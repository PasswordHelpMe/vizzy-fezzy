- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a suggested solution
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Environment**: OS, browser, Docker version, etc.

### 4. What happens next:

2. **Use environment variables**: Don't hardcode sensitive information
3. **Network security**: Only expose necessary ports
4. **HTTPS in production**: Always use HTTPS for production deployments
5. **Regular updates**: Keep your system and dependencies updated

### For Developers
1. **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
2. **Code review**: All code changes are reviewed for security issues
3. **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated
4. **CORS configuration**: Proper CORS headers are implemented
5. **Security headers**: Appropriate security headers are set

## Security Features

add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline
